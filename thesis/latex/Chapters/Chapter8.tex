Polly, by default, does not use target specific data like cache 
sizes, but instead constants as tiling block size (32) or vector width (4).  


The first nine options listed in table \reg{tab:PollyOptions} adjust the new 
created scheduling, 



\subsubsection{Non Constant Loop Bounds}
For now, the profiler is only capable of monitoring average trip counts,
not the most occurring ones (with their arity), thus it is not yet possible to 
create specialized versions for different constant trip counts.
This is an open point for future work, 
mostly dependent on the profiling infrastructure because once extracted, the 
non constant trip count is just an argument which could be replaced by a constant
without further efforts.
